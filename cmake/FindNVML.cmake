# FindNVML
# --------
#
# Find the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) includes and library. NVML documentation
# is available at: http://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/index.html
#
# Starting with CUDA 8 NVML is part of the CUDA Toolkit. Prior to CUDA 8 NVML was part
# of the GPU Deployment Kit (GDK) and GPU_DEPLOYMENT_KIT_ROOT_DIR can be specified
# if the GPU Deployment Kit is not installed in a default location.
#
# FindNVML defines the following variables:
#
#   NVML_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find nvml.h, etc.
#   NVML_LIBRARY, the libraries needed to use NVML.
#   NVML_FOUND, If false, do not try to use NVML.
